# FaceIT Account finder

The idea of this project is to use the FACEIT API to find accounts linked to the given STEAM ID(s). A similar system already exists on <https://faceitfinder.com/>, but this is limited to a single search at a time. I wish to improve the system by allowing searching for multiple players at once. Furthermore, the idea will be to allow searching using the `status` command within CS:GO.
