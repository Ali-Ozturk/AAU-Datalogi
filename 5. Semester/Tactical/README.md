    TACTICAL
</h1>

Tactical is a project which vision to allow coaches a database to store and share strategies with other players or teams. Strategies can be created with attached video and/or pictures and with tags, descriptions, comments and associated utility. This form a way for coaches or players to share strategies or utility usage with others. The main focus of the strategy is for the game CS:GO, but hope to be generic enough to allow other games as well.



The languages that is used throughout this project will be

* **PHP** - Will be used to connect to the database
* **MySQL** - Will be used for the database
* **JavaScript** - Main scripting language for the webpage
* **HTML + CSS** - Used for the webpage

## Prototype example

A prototype with no actual functionality was created in order to gain an idea of how the website will look and include. This is very early in the process and will most likely be changed a whole lot. It can be found in the [prototype](prototype) folder and requires **Apache**.
