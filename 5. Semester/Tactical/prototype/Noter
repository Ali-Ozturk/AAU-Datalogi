Remember's:
    Need to find a better way to transition between showing smokes of a specific map or strategies.
    Consider adding sections on pages for the user to easier transition between sections. (Ex. De_mirage > Smokes > A split)

DONE:
    Add background-color fade animation to buttons
    Map cards: The padding is little bit weird on the text.


TODO's:
    Generalize buttons, similar labels, headers etc.
      + Beautify the .css styling.
    Make auto-resize images on all cards. So that it's possible to add any size picture.
    Add functionality to the contact form.
    Create header, footer and meta files for ../web/
        Header should also be able to change background and style depending on the page shown on.
        - Maybe just make two separate headers?
    Add better animation and styling to play buttons on smokes/strategy page.
    Create a copy able or auto-select for the coordinates on smokes page.
    Animation effect to logo on header.
    Groupings like (Jumpthrow, crouching, etc.) Should be button-like with border and bg-color.
    Add a loading bar when accessing any new page.
    Add functionality to sorting and listing. (Requires databases in future work)
    Change "Unique smokes" to "Smokes" in map cards. More accurate-
    Add "setpos" command under gif inside the modal overlay.
    Create a default image for map cards that does not have an img in their database.
    Create a more dynamic modal. (Currently have coordinates even when its showing strats)




Bugs:
    + Fix the window going to top when clicking the play video button.
    + Padding or the margin of <h1> headers seem to have been reset? No longer 0.


Future work:
    + Create the databases for the website
    + Make everything database dependent.
    + Create an admin control panel.
    + Maybe change "Tactics" to be "Strategies". It's more accurate.
